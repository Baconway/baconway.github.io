Wrong, after the game, they went to the parking lot, just Aleksi and iM. Aleksi assumed a cowboy ready for duel pose while iM assumed a jojos bizarre adventure character pose. They stood there, silent, looking at each other..looking for an opening...THEN BAM, Aleksi strikes. A left kick hits iM right in his ribs and blood starts flowing out of his mouth. He takes a step back to recover, but Aleksi is too fast, he strikes once again, this time around for the head. What Aleksi didnt know tho is that what he was seeing was actually Ä°Ms afterimage. Right then and there, sneaked right past Aleksi and delivered a fatal strike right to his neck. The battle has concluded. A victor emerged. The silence was heavy. iM went to Aleksis lifeless body, knelt down and whispered in his ear: "Now am becometh IGL'. B1ad3, who was standing at a distance and witnessed this historic event unfold, started trembling...iMs gaze was upon him. He smiled and said the following: "You are next, LIL BRO" It was an ABSOLUTE CINEMATIC fight for the ages. You should have been there.

In all seriousness, this is my website (or an attempt at one)
Hopefully I can improve this (and my skills) as i go on
